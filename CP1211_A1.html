                <p> My favorite pass time/ hobby is gaming. I enjoy playing video games of all different types, from 
                    horror games to puzzle games and PC games to console games.  I have been playing video games since 
                    I was a little girl with my Game Boy Color. If I remember correctly the first game I ever played was 
                    a Pokemon game that I borrowed from one of my older cousins. 
                </p>

                        <figcaption>The Game Boy Color is a handheld game console made by Nintendo in 1998. It came in a 
                            multitude of different colors, some of which were special editions. The atomic purple was, in 
                            my opinion, the best color.

                <p>I have played many games in the past. Spent hundreds of hours playing different ones, and sometimes 
                    hundreds of hours on only one.  My Steam library alone is filled with over 200 games. Though I haven't 
                    had the chance to play all of them yet, out of the games that I have played and completed these are 
                    some of my favorites:
                </p>

                <br>

                    <ul class="fa-ul">
                        <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-heart fa-xs"></i></span>Don't Starve</li>
                        <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-heart fa-xs"></i></span>Don't Starve</li>
                        <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-heart fa-xs"></i></span>Oxenfree</li>
                        <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-heart fa-xs"></i></span>Hollow Knight</li>
                        <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-heart fa-xs"></i></span>Fallout 4</li>
                        <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-heart fa-xs"></i></span>Fran Bow</li>
                    </ul>

                <br>

                <p>I have many more games that I love and would put in the list above but then the list might start 
                    to grow a little too long. I can never seem to settle on one game alone that I can call my favorite, 
                    at least not for a long period of time. My answer could change depending on what mood I am in or what 
                    game I have been playing recently. Honestly, I'm sure my answer would change depending on the time of 
                    day you asked me. The games I listed above are just ones that stood out to me in my steam library, if 
                    I went through my console games the list may end up being completely different again. And to ask me to 
                    pick out one singular game to call my favorite out of any that I have played would be an impossible task.

                <p>Not only do I enjoy playing video games myself, but I also enjoy watching others play. 
                    Watching videos on <a href="https://Youtube.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>, 
                    live streams on <a href="https://Twitch.tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch</a>, 
                    or just sitting next to friends. I have always found it entertaining to watch other people play the 
                    games that I love playing myself. It also helps that when on these sites it makes the viewer feel like 
                    they are part of a community. You get to interact with people that have the same interests as you. From 
                    the content creators to the other people watching the gameplay, these websites connect people who enjoy 
                    playing video games and those who have never played before. You get to interact with like-minded people, 
                    while also learning new things about games and gaming that you may have never known.

                    With 15 <em>million</em> users daily Twitch has become a huge staple in the gaming community. It is a 
                    great place for gamers and non-gamers to go to watch their favorite streamers, interact with friends, 
                    and stream themselves.

                    videos added to the website every minute. Even if <em>many</em> of the videos added to Youtube has nothing 
                    to do with video games or gaming, the platform has been used for the gaming community since it was first created.

                <p>The three main companies that have been making consoles for years are Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo. 
                    In recent years Microsoft and Sony have been head to head in what people have dubbed the "console wars". 
                    Microsoft Xbox vs Sony Playstation, while Nintendo is still making consoles they have started to focus 
                    more on handhelds with the Nintendo Switch. Even if some people like to argue about which company is better 
                    I really don't have a favorite. I enjoy and own many consoles from all three companies.
                </p>

        <br>
        
                <p>Even if I consider myself more of a PC gamer I do have a fairly large collection of gaming consoles. 
                    I have made it a goal of mine to try and collect all of the different generations of consoles from each company. 
                    Plus no matter how much I play on my PC I always get struck with nostalgia when I hear the starting sound of 
                    the Nintendo Gamecube starting up.
