                    <p> My favorite pass time/ hobby is gaming. I enjoy playing video games of all different types, from 
                        horror games to puzzle games and PC games to console games.  I have been playing video games since 
                        I was a little girl with my Game Boy Color. If I remember correctly the first game I ever played was 
                        a Pokemon game that I borrowed from one of my older cousins.

                        I have been playing video games for years, ever since I was a very small child. 
                        Video games and gaming in general are such a large part of who I am. Gaming helps me relax, 
                        even if the game I am playing is scary or difficult. I have met many people with gaming that I am now 
                        friends with. Forming relationships that would have never been possible if I hadn't become addicted to 
                        this hobby.

                        Not to say that video games and computer games are the only type of gaming that I enjoy. 
                        I also really enjoy playing board games, card games, and roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons. 
                        Though it is easier to play computer games than get a group of people together to play the other types of games, 
                        so I end up playing video games most of the time.
