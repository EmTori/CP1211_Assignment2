                <p>Not only do I enjoy playing video games myself, but I also enjoy watching others play. 
                    Watching videos on <a href="https://Youtube.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>, 
                    live streams on <a href="https://Twitch.tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch</a>, 
                    or just sitting next to friends. I have always found it entertaining to watch other people play the 
                    games that I love playing myself. It also helps that when on these sites it makes the viewer feel like 
                    they are part of a community. You get to interact with people that have the same interests as you. From 
                    the content creators to the other people watching the gameplay, these websites connect people who enjoy 
                    playing video games and those who have never played before. You get to interact with like-minded people, 
                    while also learning new things about games and gaming that you may have never known.

                <figcaption>Twitch was created in 2011 as a live streaming service to stream video games. 
                    With 15 <em>million</em> users daily Twitch has become a huge staple in the gaming community. It is a 
                    great place for gamers and non-gamers to go to watch their favorite streamers, interact with friends, 
                    and stream themselves.

                <figcaption>YouTube is a free online video-sharing website created in 2005. There are hundreds of hours of 
                    videos added to the website every minute. Even if <em>many</em> of the videos added to Youtube has nothing 
                    to do with video games or gaming, the platform has been used for the gaming community since it was first created.
